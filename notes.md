Give me a website page using REACT and tailwind CSS where shows a jackpot numbers of 6 digits each digit must be in a box separated, add a gold button with red letters say "ROLL IT". the numbers must be centered with the digit box a little shadow in white.
The page must have background color of black with casino style, Also in the background add the rock,paper,sicssors hand emojis with differents sizes in all the screen in the background (the location must be random each time user access to the page). Also when the user Wins, then shows a popup saying the amount earned and goldshadow letters saying WINNER.
For now use dummy numbers, but do not forget that each request the backend must give you number was rolled.
IMPORTANT, this page is mainly consumed by mobiles, so focus in be responsibe the website.
